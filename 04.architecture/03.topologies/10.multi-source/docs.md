**replication-manager** supports MariaDB multi source replication, one can setup a source to be monitored and create multiple clusters with the same servers to monitor multiple channels.

The code have been tested around MariaDB server but with MySQL and Percona in mind and can be adapted for both. We are waiting for more feadbacks and test cases to declare the feature mature.
